Configured across four storeys, it was designed by Leonard Manasseh for the LCC in the 1970s as the street-facing focal point of the Arden Estate. In recent years the house has been the subject of an ingenious extension, care of Lynch Architects who used the penthouse floor as their design studio for a number of years.\r\rThe aesthetic of the building, particularly the prefabricated penthouse addition, was developed against the trend of British High Tech, which favoured layers of glazing and steel cross-bracing. Instead, the palette of materials employed is largely natural; timber frames and birch plywood ceilings not only create a warmth inside, but also serve as structural alternatives to heavily manufactured materials. The result is a series of flowing spaces that reflect an honesty and integrity in their materials.\r\rEntry is gained on the ground floor, where a staircase ascends to the first floor communal areas. The L-shaped plan has been exploited on this level to allow for two large balconies; the west-facing balcony has the house\u2019s defining external feature, a glazed conservatory with a large vertical section of glazing above, extending to the second floor. The steep pitch of this glazed section not only allows wonderful levels of natural light to stream into the first and second floors, but also echoes the linear sections of glazing on the penthouse level. Currently, the conservatory is used as a winter garden and a wonderful spot for breakfast, adjoining the kitchen. The balcony at the rear is accessed via a set of glazed doors from the living room and faces north towards the Arden Estate. There are linoleum floors across this level and beautiful exposed copper pipes run along sections of wall.\r\rThe second floor is comprised of two bedrooms and a family bathroom. The smaller of the two bedrooms has a large section of sloped glazing with wonderful views, while the other has plenty of built-in storage space. The third floor is formed of the penthouse, currently configured as a second living room, it also has an adjoining WC and second kitchen. It was constructed offsite as per Lynch Architects\u2019 instruction and was craned onto the existing structure, along with the many glass panes that run around its edge. Oak mullions frame each section of glazing, as well as the breath-taking panoramic views of the city beyond. The windows open, as does a roof light, to create natural ventilation and the rooftop lantern acts a solar chimney.\r\rThe house is positioned on Hoxton Street; during the 19th Century, the street and surrounding area became the centre of the Shoreditch furniture and carpentry trade. Today, Hoxton is renowned for its exciting mix of restaurants, bars and galleries, including Lyle\u2019s, Rochelle Canteen, Shoreditch House, Ace Hotel, the Blue Mountain School and Victoria Miro Gallery. The boutiques and cafes of Redchurch Street and Spitalfields are also nearby.\r\rThere are plenty of transport links, all within walking distance. Hoxton Station runs London Overground services and Liverpool Street Station connects via the Central, Hammersmith and City, and Metropolitan lines, as well as National Rail services nationwide.
